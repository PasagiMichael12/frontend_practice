Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty()
Returns a boolean indicating whether an object contains the specified 
property as a direct property of that object and not inherited through the prototype chain.

key()

Object.keys() returns an array whose elements are strings corresponding to the enumerable properties 
found directly upon object. 
The ordering of the properties is the same as that given by looping over the properties of the object manually.

Object.keys(obj) – returns an array of keys.
Object.values(obj) – returns an array of values.
Object.entries(obj) – returns an array of [key, value] pairs.

Object.fromEntries()
The Object.fromEntries() method transforms a list of key-value pairs into an object.

for/in - for objects
for of = for iterable items (array)

Object.getOwnPropertyNames()
Returns an array containing the names of all of the given object's own enumerable and non-enumerable properties.

Object.prototype.toLocaleString(<element>)
Calls toString().

Object.create() very simply returns a
 new object with the specified prototype and any additional properties you want to add
Note: Object Constructors always starts with capital letter

prototype
 Stated simply, the prototype is another object that the original object inherits from, 
 which is to say, the original object has access to all of its prototype’s methods and properties.


property == key
value == key value
