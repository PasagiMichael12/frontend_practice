hasOwnProperty()

All descendants of Object inherit the hasOwnProperty method. This method can be used to determine whether 
an object has the specified property as a direct property of that object; unlike the in operator,
this method does not check for a property in the object's prototype chain. 
If an Object is an Array, hasOwnProperty method can check whether an index exists.

key()

Object.keys() returns an array whose elements are strings corresponding to the enumerable properties 
found directly upon object. 
The ordering of the properties is the same as that given by looping over the properties of the object manually.

Object.keys(obj) – returns an array of keys.
Object.values(obj) – returns an array of values.
Object.entries(obj) – returns an array of [key, value] pairs.
