uses constructors as class

OOP - Object Oriented Programming
- based on real world scenarion/things

4 Pillars of OOP  - Lexical Scope
Abstraction - simple model of a more complex thing
-dvd player 



Encapsulation - 
it binds the code and the data together and keeps them safe from outside interference.


Inheritance - const pasagi = new jamol / uses constructor



Polymorphism - many forms ---- method overriding/overloading
- is the process of using same method name by
multiple classes and redefines methods for the derived classes.

Class & Object
Class - parent, whole, majority
Object - child, pieces, characteristics, properties

this 
refers to the current object in a method or constructor.

function createNewPerson(name) {
  const obj = {};
  obj.name = name;
  obj.greeting = function() {
    alert('Hi! I\'m ' + obj.name + '.');
  };
  return obj;
}
