Inheritance
Some matrices are known to be symmetric. If you mirror a symmetric matrix around its top-left-to-bottom-right diagonal, 
it stays the same. In other words, the value stored at x,y is always the same as that at y,x.

Inherits the same process and apply to the procedure.

The new class inherits properties and behavior from the old class.

class SymmetricMatrix extends Matrix {
  constructor(size, element = (x, y) => undefined) {
    super(size, size, (x, y) => {
      if (x < y) return element(y, x);
      else return element(x, y);
    });
  }

  set(x, y, value) {
    super.set(x, y, value);
    if (x != y) {
      super.set(y, x, value);
    }
  }
}

let matrix = new SymmetricMatrix(5, (x, y) => `${x},${y}`);
console.log(matrix.get(2, 3));
