//Strings
-- getting the length in javascript
-> .length
example:
let name ="Allon";
let numOfStrings = name.length; 

//Escape Chars
-- having quotes in a string
uses:
\' , \" , \\ , \

//returning String vs Object
let x = "Allon" <-- x is string
let y = new String("Allon")<-- y is an Object

// == vs ===
let x = "Allon" 
let y = new String("Allon")
( x == y ) <== is true x and y have same value
" == " = just looking for value inside, not the its typeof
( x === y ) <== is false diff in types
(String and objects)

let x = new String("Allon")
let y = new String("Allon")

( x == y ) = false, x and y are diff objects
( x === y ) = false, compaing two javascript objects will always return false
