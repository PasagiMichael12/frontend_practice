let = re-assign values;

//installed js es6 code snippets for 
shortcuts

creating basic calculator using javascript
for html

! + tab = shortcut for DOCTYPE <html></html>

Add form tag to the body, 
two inputs that are defined as firstNumber and secondNumber in the id,
select tag named operator same as in id
p tag for revealing the answer
and two buttons name Compute and Reset

for initiating js
create function method called Compute and reload
in compute method
the variables are firstNumber, secondNumber,operator,messag.
i get their values using there id 
and set result as 0

i declared first and second variable also by using parseint to convert the values to integer

and using switch case to do the functions

for the validation, checking if the textboxes are set or have a values inside 
if not, the alert function will call same as the if statement with operator variable inside.
